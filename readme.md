# GAME TRADE

## By Benjamin Huang and Alicia Poindexter

Post your games for trade. Find games that are available for trade. Select games that interest you and offer one of your games to trade. Accept or decline trades offered by other users. Much of the sorting & filtering are built into the app for you. You are only shown trades that you are involved in, when you look at available items, you only see the ones that are available for trade that belong to other users. An item can only be involved in one pending trade at a time.

To begin enter `npm run setup`.  This will install all dependencies.
